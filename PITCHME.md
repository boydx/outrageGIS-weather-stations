## Organization
@ul[squares]
* Keep GIS folder organized
* Be consistent
* Don't put a file >50 MB in repo
* Don't put a .gdb folder in repo
* Don't put a repo in repo
@ulend

---
## Example folder structure

---
## Undo?
* Can undo almost anything
* "Revert This Commit" is for single undo in GitHub
* More complex undo need to use Git command line
* [Cheat sheet](https://blog.github.com/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/)


---
## Use your student resources
@ul[squares]
* Microsoft or Google cloud storage
* Sync large files remotely
* Access via your LinkBlue account
@ulend

---
## Add all layers
* Explore how to symbolize layers
* Reorder them in the **Contents** pane
* Flex your GIS muscle memory!

---
## Start coding
* Getting scrappy with Python!
* Watch [second lesson videos](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/intro) in *Python for Everybody*


---
## Python 
@ul[squares]
* Modular programming
* functions >> modules >> packages
    * for: simplicity, maintainability, reusability, addressing
* An open-source quilt of contributions

## Managing your environment
@ul[squares]
* A development environment is a constellation of packages
* Most depend on a distinct version of other packages
* Chain of dependencies must not be broken!
* Create virtual environments

## Dependency Hell
[Yep, there's a term for it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell)

## Python in ArcGIS Pro
@ul[squares]
* Built-in Package Management
* Development in Windows OS only
* Make clone of default read-only environment
@ulend


---
## Python in VS Code
@ul[squares]
* Use Anaconda or ArcGIS Pro
* Create *.py* files to execute in terminal
* Develop on most operating systems
* Create first program: "Geography, Y'all!"
@ulend

---
## Development in ArcGIS Pro
@ul[squares]
* Jupyter Notebook creates *.ipynb* files
* Run cells of code rather than the entire script
* Cells can be Python or Markdown
@ulend

---
## Setting up geoprocessing 
@ul[squares]
* ArcPy is the Python package that ships with ArcGIS Pro
* Very well documented
* Typically other properties are set to customize your workflow
